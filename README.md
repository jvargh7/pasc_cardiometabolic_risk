## Study Importance
### What is already known about this subject? 
Higher body mass index is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 infection may be a risk factor for obesity-related illnesses including type 2 diabetes.   
Body mass index and obesity increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period for the general population, but it is unknown if these differences were consistent by SARS-CoV-2 infection status.

### What are the new findings in your manuscript? 
SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with weight retention in a diverse real-world cohort, relative to a contemporary uninfected control group that decreased in weight.   
Associations were consistent across sex, age, race-ethnicity groups, and by hospitalization status.

### How might your results change the direction of research or the focus of clinical practice?
Numerous mechanisms may be contributing to increased weight retention after COVID-19 infection, including pathophysiologic changes associated with long COVID, lifestyle changes made during recovery from COVID-19 infection, or changes in socioeconomic factors or healthcare utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should further investigate these potential mechanisms as well as the long-term impact of weight retention associated with COVID-19.

## Abstract 
### Objective
To study body mass index (BMI) changes before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults without diabetes.

### Methods
Using real-world data from the OneFlorida+ clinical research network, we compared changes over time in BMI in an Exposed cohort (positive SARS-CoV-2 test between March 2020 - January 2022, n=44,436), to a contemporary Unexposed cohort (negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, n=164,118), and an age/sex-matched Historical control cohort (March 2018 - January 2020, n=41,189). We used target trial approaches to estimate BMI at baseline and change per 100 days of follow-up for Unexposed and Historical cohorts relative to the Exposed cohort by categories of sex, race-ethnicity, age, and hospitalization status.

### Results
At the start of the follow-up period relative to the Exposed cohort (29.3 kg/m2 [95%CI: 29.0, 29.7]), the Unexposed (-0.07 kg/m2 [95%CI;-0.12,-0.01]) and Historical controls (-0.27 kg/m2 [95%CI;-0.34,-0.20]) had lower BMI. Relative to no change in the Exposed per 100 days (0.00 kg/m2 [95%CI;-0.03,0.03]), the BMI of Unexposed cohort decreased (-0.04 kg/m2 [95%CI;-0.06,-0.01]) while the Historical cohort increased (0.03 kg/m2 [95%CI;0.00,0.06]). BMI changes were consistent between Exposed and Unexposed cohorts for most population groups. 

### Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with weight retention, relative to a contemporary uninfected control group that had decreased weight.
